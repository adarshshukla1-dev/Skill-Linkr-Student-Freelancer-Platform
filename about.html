      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Skill Linkr was founded with a simple idea — to give talented students a
        fair chance to earn, grow, and prove their skills through real-world
        projects. Many students struggle to find opportunities despite having
        the right talent, and small businesses or startups struggle to afford
        skilled freelancers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Skill Linkr bridges that gap by connecting student freelancers directly
        with clients at minimal prices — creating a win-win ecosystem for both.
